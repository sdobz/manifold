# IO

IO is used to input and output from the script. This can be as simple as printing:

<io println='"Hello World"' />

## Ref URI

One goal of manifold is to enable document synchronization. Documents can be identified with their URI. Examples of uris are:

* `./relative/path`
* `file:///home/user/absolute/uri`
* `https://example.com/http/url`
* `git:///repo.host/group/repo/file`
